The TLRU cache implementation was adapted from the excellent BitFaster.Caching

by Alex Peck (MIT license).

https://github.com/bitfaster/BitFaster.Caching

We have chosen to avoid a direct dependency at this time so that we can independantly
adjust internal mechanisms when required to suit our caching requirements.

API compatibility wil be preserved and we may introduce the dependancy on a later date if no
changes are required.
